"""SQLAlchemy ORM models.

History is event-sourced:

* ``applications``       - every submitted request, rejected submissions are
                           never persisted (see whole-request validation);
* ``approval_events``    - append-only approval record, one per revision
                           (``auto_approved``/``release_revision`` mark
                           approvals granted automatically from the waitlist
                           during a suspend/revoke release);
* ``suspension_events``  - append-only record of a temporary outage: an
                           approved license is taken out of the effective set,
                           one per revision;
* ``resumption_events``  - append-only record restoring a suspended license
                           after re-adjudication, one per revision (keeps the
                           guard band snapshot the re-decision used);
* ``revocation_events``  - append-only revocation record, one per revision
                           (a suspended license may be permanently revoked);
* ``license_transfer_events`` - append-only equipment-change handover record,
                           one per handover, keyed by the revocation revision;
                           links the ordinary revocation of the source license
                           and the ordinary (manual) approval of its pending
                           successor, which keep two consecutive revisions;
* ``guard_band_events``  - append-only guard-band record, one per revision
                           (revision 0 is the initial value seeded at database
                           creation, every later row is one confirmed online
                           change);
* ``waitlist_entries``    - FIFO queue of pending applications registered as
                           standbys while the band is busy; registration and
                           cancellation consume no revision and the entry is
                           removed on approval (manual or automatic);
* ``restriction_windows`` - currently active temporary spectrum-control
                           windows (confirmed but not yet released); each
                           confirmation/release consumes one revision;
* ``restriction_window_events`` - append-only activation/release records for
                           restriction windows, one per revision, so snapshots
                           reconstruct the windows active at any revision;
* ``emergency_occupations`` - one row per burst-communication emergency
                           frequency grab: the emergency application, its
                           approval revision, the spanned force-suspension
                           revisions and the release revision (NULL while
                           active).  The forced suspensions are ordinary
                           ``suspension_events`` rows flagged ``forced``, the
                           release-time restorations are ordinary
                           ``resumption_events`` rows flagged
                           ``forced_recovery``, and the emergency approval /
                           release revocation are ordinary approval /
                           revocation events flagged ``emergency`` /
                           ``emergency_release``;
* ``scheduled_approvals`` - one row per operator-booked UTC auto-approval
                           appointment for a pending application.  Exactly one
                           ``scheduled`` row may exist per application; it is
                           either cancelled/rescheduled before firing,
                           invalidated when the application is decided by
                           another path, or processed exactly once at its due
                           time (re-adjudicated then: approved on one new
                           revision, or recorded blocked while the
                           application stays pending and no revision is used).
                           The approval itself is an ordinary
                           ``approval_events`` row flagged ``scheduled``;
* ``revision_meta``      - singleton row holding the current revision number
                           and the guard band currently in force.

A revocation never deletes history: it only removes an application from the
effective set used by later adjudications.  A suspension does the same
temporarily until a resumption puts the license back.  Snapshots for any past
revision are reconstructed from the event tables, including the guard band in
force at that revision.  Approval events keep their own immutable copy of the
band they were decided under and are never rewritten; resumption events keep
the band of their own re-adjudication.

    one consecutive revision each, in a fixed order (each is an ordinary
    ``SuspensionEvent`` flagged ``forced`` and **does not** trigger a waitlist
    re-adjudication); a queued emergency application leaves the waitlist; the
    emergency license is then approved (an ordinary ``ApprovalEvent`` flagged
    ``emergency``) at the next consecutive revision.  The original approval
    records of the force-suspended licenses are never rewritten.

    An emergency license can neither be ordinarily suspended nor ordinarily
    revoked; the occupation ends only through the dedicated release (which
    revokes the emergency license, restores the still-suspended licenses one
    by one after re-adjudication and finally drains the waitlist, all
    atomically).  A force-suspended license can be revoked ordinarily but an
    ordinary resume is refused while its emergency is active.  A stale
    expected revision or a repeated release leaves the state untouched.

    The row is the mutable current-state mirror (``released_revision`` is
    NULL while active) and the audit link between the revisions; the append-
    only approval/suspension/resumption/revocation events are the source of
    truth for historical revision snapshots.

class ScheduledApproval(Base):
    """An operator-booked UTC auto-approval appointment for one application.

    Operators book an appointment for a ``pending`` application at a UTC
    instant strictly after the booking time and strictly before the
    application's own time window ends.  Booking consumes no revision; at most
    one ``scheduled`` row exists per application (partial unique index), and
    it may be cancelled or rescheduled before it fires.

    A background sweeper (and a startup catch-up pass) processes due rows
    inside the shared singleton revision arbitration.  At the actual
    processing instant the application is re-adjudicated against the live
    guard band, the current effective set and every active restriction
    window:

    * it passes  -> one ordinary ``ApprovalEvent`` flagged ``scheduled``
      consumes exactly one new revision, a queued application leaves the
      waitlist first, and the appointment becomes ``approved``;
    * it clashes or hits a window -> the blockers are recorded on this row,
      the appointment becomes ``blocked``, the application stays ``pending``
      and no revision is consumed; nothing is retried automatically.

    An application decided first by another path -- a manual single/batch
    approval, a license-handover successor approval, an emergency occupation
    or a waitlist auto-approval during a suspend/revoke/emergency-release
    drain -- leaves its appointment ``invalidated`` inside the same
    transaction, so it can never fire afterwards.  Cancellation,
    rescheduling, due processing and the other decisions therefore compete
    under one arbitration and exactly one outcome wins; a restart never
    approves the same appointment twice (only ``scheduled`` rows fire).
