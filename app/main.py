Concurrency
-----------
Approval locks the singleton ``revision_meta`` row (``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE``)
for the duration of the transaction.  Concurrent single approvals, batch
approvals, suspensions, resumptions, revocations and guard-band changes
therefore serialise on the same revision arbitration: losers re-adjudicate
against the winner's commit and are refused with ``stale_revision`` or
``interference``.  A batch either consumes one consecutive revision per
member in input order, or nothing at all; a guard-band change, a suspension
or a resumption consumes exactly one revision.

Temporary outages
-----------------
A suspension immediately removes an approved license from the effective set
without touching its original approval.  A resumption re-adjudicates the
license against the live guard band and all currently effective licenses; a
stale revision or renewed interference is refused (returning the current
revision or the conflicting licenses) while the license stays suspended and
no revision is consumed.  A suspended license may also be permanently
revoked with the ordinary revoke operation; a revoked license can never be
resumed.  Both operations append immutable events so historical snapshots
restore the suspended/effective status and the effective set at every
revision.

Guard band
----------
The live guard band is stored on the ``revision_meta`` row and seeded once
from the ``GUARD_BAND`` environment variable (restarts never overwrite it).
Every adjudication (preview, single/batch approval, resumption) uses the
live value; each confirmed change is appended as an immutable
``guard_band_events`` record so historical revision snapshots restore the
band in force at the time.  Approval and resumption events keep their own
copy of the band they were decided under and are never rewritten.

Waitlist
--------
A pending application may be registered as a standby while the band is
busy.  Registration and cancellation consume no revision and never change
the application's status; an application is queued at most once.  When a
suspension or a revoke releases an effective license, the same transaction
drains the queue in registration order: each entry is re-adjudicated under
the live guard band against the licenses effective so far (including the
automatic approvals just granted), passers are approved immediately and
consume the following consecutive revisions, blockers keep their place and
the drain continues.  A manual approval removes the queue entry first, so
a manually decided application is never auto-approved.  Every automatic
approval is an ordinary ``ApprovalEvent`` flagged ``auto_approved`` with the
release revision, which lets revision snapshots restore the automatic
decisions one revision at a time.

Restriction windows
-------------------
Operators temporarily control part of the spectrum with restriction
windows: a coverage circle, a closed frequency band and a half-open UTC
interval, plus a reason.  A read-only rehearsal preview lists the currently
effective licenses and standby applications the proposal would hit (and the
revision it is based on) without changing state; the confirmation carries
the expected revision, consumes one revision and activates the window.
Existing effective licenses that the window hits stay effective, but from
that revision onwards pending previews, single/batch approvals, suspended
license resumptions and post-release waitlist auto-approvals all report hit
windows, and no write may make a hit application effective.  A hit needs the
circle, half-open time and closed frequency band all to intersect (touching
band endpoints hit); the guard band never extends a window.  Releasing a
window by its id and the expected revision consumes another revision but
only affects later adjudication (it never auto-approves the waitlist).
Activations and releases are immutable events, so revision snapshots and
comparisons restore the windows active at the time; original approval
events are never rewritten.

License handover (active-device swap)
-------------------------------------
When an active device is replaced, the operator hands one currently
effective license to a pending application.  A read-only rehearsal names
the source license, the successor application and an operator reason and
returns the current revision, the interference the successor would still
see once the source is excluded from the effective set, and the active
restriction windows it hits; it never mutates state.  The confirmation adds
the expected revision and runs inside the same singleton revision
arbitration as every other writer: it re-checks that the source is still
effective, the successor is still pending, the revision is current, and
that (with the source removed) no license interferes and no restriction
window is hit.  Only then does the whole transaction take effect: the
ordinary source revocation consumes one revision and the ordinary successor
approval consumes the next consecutive revision.  A successor queued as a
standby first leaves the queue (its approval is a manual one and is never
flagged ``auto_approved``); afterwards the remaining standbys are
re-adjudicated by the existing FIFO drain, whose auto approvals consume the
following revisions and keep ``release_revision`` pointing at the handover's
revocation revision.  A stale revision, a status change, interference or a
window hit rejects the whole handover: licenses, the queue and the revision
are left untouched.  The handover appends one immutable
``license_transfer_events`` row linking its two revisions, so revision
snapshots and comparisons restore every revision exactly; existing
revocation and approval semantics (and startup) are unchanged.

Burst-communication emergency occupations
-----------------------------------------
When burst traffic must take spectrum urgently, an operator rehearses the
grab with a pending application id and an operator reason: the read-only
preview returns the current revision, the ordinary effective licenses the
grab would force-suspend, any *already-emergency* licenses it would
interfere with (one emergency never suspends another), and the active
restriction windows it hits; state is untouched.  The confirmation carries
the expected revision and, inside the shared revision arbitration,
re-checks that the emergency application is still pending, hits no window
and clashes with no other emergency license -- otherwise the whole grab is
rejected and nothing changes.  On success the interfering ordinary
licenses are force-suspended first, one consecutive revision each, as
ordinary ``SuspensionEvent`` rows flagged ``forced`` (this deliberately
does not trigger a waitlist re-adjudication); a queued emergency
application leaves the queue; the emergency license is then approved at
the next consecutive revision as an ordinary ``ApprovalEvent`` flagged
``emergency``.  Original approval records are never rewritten.

A force-suspended license can be revoked as usual, but an ordinary resume
is refused while its emergency is active; an emergency license can be
neither ordinarily suspended nor ordinarily revoked -- the occupation ends
only through the dedicated release, which names the emergency application
id and the expected revision.  The release is one atomic transaction: it
first revokes the emergency license (an ordinary ``RevocationEvent``
flagged ``emergency_release``), then re-adjudicates the licenses still
force-suspended by that occupation in their original suspension order
against the live guard band, the effective set so far and every active
window; passers resume one consecutive revision each (ordinary
``ResumptionEvent`` rows flagged ``forced_recovery``), blocked licenses
stay suspended as ordinary outages (their emergency marker is cleared) and
their blocking conflicts/window hits are returned; finally the standby
queue is re-adjudicated by the existing FIFO drain.  A stale revision or a
repeated release changes nothing.  Snapshots and comparisons restore every
phase revision by revision through the ordinary event replay plus the
``emergency_occupations`` audit rows.

Scheduled auto-approvals
------------------------
An operator may book a UTC auto-approval appointment for a pending
application at an instant strictly after the booking moment and strictly
before the application's own time window ends.  Booking consumes no
revision; an unknown/non-pending application or an invalid instant is
rejected without leaving an appointment.  At most one waiting appointment
exists per application and it may be cancelled or rescheduled before it
fires.  A background sweeper (with a startup catch-up pass) processes due
appointments inside the shared revision arbitration: at the actual
processing instant the application is re-adjudicated against the live
guard band, every effective license and every active restriction window.
A pass approves it on one new revision as an ordinary ``ApprovalEvent``
flagged ``scheduled`` (a queued application leaves the waitlist first;
the waitlist is not re-adjudicated afterwards); a clash or window hit is
recorded as the appointment's blocking detail, the application stays
pending, no revision is consumed and nothing is retried automatically.
A decision through any other path -- manual single/batch approval,
waitlist auto-approval, a handover or an emergency occupation --
invalidates the waiting appointment in the same transaction, so due
processing, cancellation, rescheduling and other decisions compete under
one lock and exactly one outcome wins; a restart never double-approves.
